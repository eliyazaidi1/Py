# Sorting Techniques using Object-Oriented Programming in Python

This Python program demonstrates various sorting techniques implemented using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 
OOP provides a clean and modular way to organize and implement different sorting algorithms.

## Sorting Algorithms Implemented:
1. **Bubble Sort**: A simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
2. **Selection Sort**: An algorithm that finds the minimum element from the unsorted portion of the list and moves it to the sorted portion.
3. **Insertion Sort**: An algorithm that builds the sorted list one element at a time by inserting each unsorted element into its correct position.
4. **Merge Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that recursively divides the list into smaller sublists, sorts them, and then merges them back together.
5. **Quick Sort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that selects a pivot element, partitions the list into two sublists, and recursively sorts the sublists.
6. **Heap Sort**: An algorithm that builds a binary heap data structure from the list, sorts the heap, and then extracts the elements from the heap in sorted order.
